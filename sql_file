Sun Tzu harped on the significance of placement in military tactics. The planning to position an army must be dependent on the stipulations in the physical surroundings and the subjective thoughts of various militants in those conditions. He believed that strategy cannot be considered as planning with respect to glancing through a previously decided list. It is better represented by the fact that it needs speedy and suitable reactions to altering situations. Planning gives results in restrained surroundings. But in case of an altering environment, similar plans come in each other’s ways and give rise to undesired outcomes.

It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell & Co. Treasure Island is traditionally considered a coming-of-age story, and is noted for its atmosphere, characters, and action. It is also noted as a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality—as seen in Long John Silver—unusual for childrens literature. It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels. Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates, including such elements as treasure maps marked with an \"X\", schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.',8.99,'https://books.google.com/books/content/images/frontcover/KMkDDQAAQBAJ?fife=w400-h600',0,12,NULL),('Jesus','The Holy Bible: King James Version','9783736801493','King James Version','The Holy Bible.
